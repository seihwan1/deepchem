  Returns an int < size representing given ECFP fragment.

  Parameters

    String to hash. Usually an ECFP fragment.
  size: int, optional (default 1024)
    Hash to an int in range [0, size)

  Input must be a tuple of strings. This utility is primarily used for

  hashed together to achieve one hash value for this contact region.

    Pair of ECFP fragment strings

  """Helper function to vectorize a spatial description from a hash.

  Hash functions are used to perform spatial featurizations in
  DeepChem. However, it's necessary to convert backwards from
  the hash function to feature vectors. This function aids in
  this conversion procedure. It creates a vector of zeros of length
  `seize`. It then loops through `feature_dict`, uses `hash_function`
  to hash the stored value to an integer in range [0, size) and bumps
  that index.

  Parameters
  ----------
  hash_function: function
    Should accept two arguments, `feature`, and `size` and
    return a hashed integer. Here `feature` is the item to
    hash, and `size` is an int. For example, if `size=1024`,
    then hashed values must fall in range `[0, 1024)`.
  feature_dict: dict
    Maps unique keys to features computed. 
  size: int, optional (default 1024)
    Length of generated bit vector

  In many applications, it's desirable to look at binding pockets on
  macromolecules which may be good targets for potential ligands or
  other molecules to interact with. A `BindingPocketFeaturizer`
  expects to be given a macromolecule, and a list of pockets to
  featurize on that macromolecule. These pockets should be of the form
  produced by a `dc.dock.BindingPocketFinder`, that is as a list of
  `dc.utils.CoordinateBox` objects.

  The base featurization in this class's featurization is currently
  very simple and counts the number of residues of each type present
  in the pocket. It's likely that you'll want to overwrite this
  implementation for more sophisticated downstream usecases.
